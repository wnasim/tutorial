# Tutorial

Here is my changes to the Readme file we cloned last Wednesday Jan. 13.
First I read through http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1

Then I went through https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/ to get an
idea of what GitHub is.

Given GitHub already has a built-in tutorial, that is the best way to start using various features of Git: Branch, Committee, Push etc.
